# Project: NETRAM Eyewear Shop

[Live version of the site can be found here](https://netram-eyewear.netlify.app/)

NETRAM Eyewear is a mock-up of an e-commerce website that sells eyewear products. The website offers a range of eyewear products, including prescription glasses and trendy sunglasses & frames. This project was created as a practice on using React Router.

## Features

1.Cart: The website has a cart feature where users can add items and then edit out their desired quantities on checkout. The cart is updated instantly and is passed down through a Cart Redux saga.

2.Paginations: The website supports pagination to enhance user experience while browsing through the eyewear products. Users can easily navigate through the different pages of the product catalog.

3.Product Search: The website includes a search bar, allowing users to quickly find the products they are looking for. The search functionality using Debouncing is fast and reliable, making it easy to find the perfect pair of glasses.

4.Product Sorter: The website also features a product sorter, allowing users to sort the eyewear products based on a range of criteria. Users can sort by price, popularity, and alphabetically, making it easy to find the best products for their needs.
